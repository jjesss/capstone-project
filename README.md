## How to play the game

Tic-Tac-Toe is a 2-player game played on a 3×3 grid. One player is X, and the other is O. Players take turns placing their mark in any empty square. The goal is to be the first to get three in a row—horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If all nine squares fill up without either player making three in a row, the game ends in a draw.
